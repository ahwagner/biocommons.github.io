# Hackathon 2023

The [GA4GH 11th Plenary meeting](https://broadinstitute.swoogo.com/ga4gh11thplenary) will be held in
San Francisco September 19-22, 2023. We are currently planning an in-person hackathon in the days
before the event. 

Join the [biocommons-hacakathons](https://groups.google.com/g/biocommons-hackathons) list to learn
more.  We may consider a remote hacking event if there's sufficient interest.
