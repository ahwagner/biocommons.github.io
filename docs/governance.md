# Governance

**This governance document provides a framework for the organization, decision making, and essential
values of the biocommons project. The Steering Committee (proposed below) will refine this document
as needed in order to serve the needs of the biocommons objectives.**

## Mission

The goal of the biocommons project is accelerate research, promote data sharing, and improve human
health by collaborating on interoperable, high-quality, bioinformatics software and data for
sequence variant interpretation, and to foster a community that develops these tools.

## Values

- write high-quality code; good engineering practices
- assume good intentions
- be transparent
- interoperability, think about the whole
- high quality 
- minimal friction / transparent process / minimal frustration
- Roadmap planning
- blocker elimination mechanism
- Key stakeholders / project decision-makers
- interoperability
- consistency
- encourage contributions
- encourage input on directions
- mentorship
- community of contributors
- rewarding engagement

- Lightweight process with a focus on outcomes
- Reliable, high-quality, and clinical-grade software
- Coherency, consistency, predictability, principle of least surprise
- Interoperable software
- Mission and community
- Mentorship and learning. Openness by default. Diversity.
- Presumption of good intentions
- Common practices and tools.

## Membership

Members of the biocommons are individuals who make actively contribute to the overall project and
uphold our [values](values.md) and [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.md). Contributions may include
any activity that furthers the mission, such as writing documentation, providing technical
assistance in forums, triaging issues, managing projects, providing logistics support, and coding.

Members who violate biocommons values or the code of conduct may be suspended from participation in
the biocommons, including leadership positions.

The biocommons does not currently provide a mechanism for membership by institutions or
organizations.

## Organizational Needs and Teams

The biocommons has the following structure:

- An **Executive Director**, who leads the biocommons during the transition from the current (2022)
  informal affiliation to a more organized open source project.
- The **Steering Committee** provides general administrative oversight for the biocommons project.
- The **Project Teams** plan and coordinate development activities within their projects,
  consistent with biocommons architectural directions.

### Executive Director

STOPPED HERE

The Architecture Team:

- Is comprised of the Architecture Lead and other members who are appointed by the Steering
  Committee.
- Makes project-wide techincal decisions in order to foster consisitency and interoperability.
- Establishes coding guidelines.
- Participates in project code reviews as requested.


The Executive Director will set
  coding guidelines and standards in order maximize the utility of biocommons software and data. The
  Executive Director will also arrange technical and systems administration support, such as AWS
  infrastructure and web site development.


It is expected that Project Leads (below) should attend Architectural Team meetings in order to
raise issues or concerns, and to ensure that projects remain aligned and coordinated. Decisions in
the Architecture Team are expected to be made by consensus. The Executive Director is a member of
the Architecture Team and may override decisions in exceptional circumstances.


### Steering Committee

The Steering Committee:

- Is resposible for the development of a healthy organization.
- Updates this governance document and resolves questions about its interpretation.
- Selects leaders for other teams.
- Receives and responds to issues regarding membership and breaches of community standards.

The Steering Committee is comprised of the Executive Director and other members who are invited by the
Executive Director.  The Steering Committee is expected to meet every 3 months.  Decisions in the
Steering Committee are made by the Executive Director with input from Steering Committee members.


### Project Teams

Project Teams are responsible for planning and coordinating development activities within their
projects. A project typically corresponds to one or more related source code repositories.

Project Teams should have at least two Project Leads, appointed by the Steering Committee. The Project
Leads are the primary maintainers of the relevant repositories.

Management of project repositories should be consistent with the overall biocommons [coding
guidelines](coding-guidelines.md).

### Team Leadership

Team leaders are nominated by the Steering Committee based on recognized domain expertise and
sustained contribution to the biocommons.

### Other Teams and Roles

The Steering Committee may identify and create additional roles and teams as needed, such as project
management, documentation, testing, technical support, logistics, AWS infrastructure management,
GitHub account management, and web site support.

    Common goods fail because of a failure to coordinate collective action. To scale and sustain an
    open source project, open source communities need to transition from individual, uncoordinated
    action to cooperative, coordinated action. [From [3 Models for Open Source
