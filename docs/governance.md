# Governance

**This governance document provides a framework for the organization, decision making, and essential
values of the biocommons project. The Steering Committee (proposed below) will refine this document
as needed in order to serve the needs of the biocommons objectives.**

## Mission

The goal of the biocommons project is accelerate research, promote data sharing, and improve human
health by collaborating on interoperable, high-quality, bioinformatics software and data for
sequence variant interpretation, and to foster a community that develops these tools.

## Membership

Members of the biocommons are individuals who make actively contribute to the overall project and
uphold our [values](values.md) and [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.md). Contributions may include
any activity that furthers the mission, such as writing documentation, providing technical
assistance in forums, triaging issues, managing projects, providing logistics support, and coding.

Members who violate biocommons values or the code of conduct may be suspended from participation in
the biocommons, including leadership positions.

The biocommons does not currently provide a mechanism for membership by institutions or
organizations.

## Organizational Needs and Teams

The biocommons has the following structure:

- The **Steering Committee** provides general administrative oversight for the biocommons project.
- The **Project Teams** plan and coordinate development activities within their projects,
  consistent with biocommons architectural directions.

### Steering Committee

The Steering Committee:

- Is resposible for fostering a healthy organization, including promoting events, engaging with the
  scientific community, and enforcing our code of conduct.
- Updates this governance document and resolves questions about its interpretation.
- Selects leaders for project teams.
- Receives and responds to issues regarding membership and breaches of community standards.
- Makes project-wide techinical decisions in order to foster consisitency and interoperability.
- Establishes coding guidelines and standards in order maximize the utility of biocommons software
  and data.
- Participates in project code reviews as requested.
- Arrange technical and systems administration support, such as AWS infrastructure and web site
  development.

The Steering Committee is comprised of the Executive Director and other members who are invited by
the Executive Director. Decisions in the Steering Committee are made by the Executive Director with
input from Steering Committee members. The Steering Committee is expected to meet every 3 months.  

### Project Teams

Project Teams are responsible for planning and coordinating development activities within their
projects. A project typically corresponds to one or more related source code repositories.

Project Teams should have at least two Project Leads, appointed by the Steering Committee. The
Project Leaders are the primary maintainers of the relevant repositories. Project Leaders are
nominated by the Steering Committee based on recognized domain expertise and sustained contribution
to the biocommons.  Project Leaders are expected to ensure that project repositories are managed
consistent with the overall biocommons [coding guidelines](coding-guidelines.md).

### Other Teams and Roles

The Steering Committee may identify and create additional roles and teams as needed, such as project
management, documentation, testing, technical support, logistics, AWS infrastructure management,
GitHub account management, and web site support.
