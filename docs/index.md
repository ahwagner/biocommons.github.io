!!! note "Biocommons Hackathon in September 2023"

    The GA4GH 11th Plenary meeting will be held in San Francisco September 19-22, 2023. We are
    currently planning an in-person hackathon in the days before the event.  See [Hackathon 2023](hackathon-2023/) for more.

## Projects

### Released

- [bioutils](https://github.com/biocommons/bioutils) provides common tools and lookup tables used
  primarily by the hgvs and uta packages
- [eutils](https://github.com/biocommons/eutils) simplifies searching, fetching, and parsing records
  from NCBI using their E-utilities interface
- [hgvs](https://github.com/biocommons/hgvs) parses, formats, validates, normalizes,
  and transforms sequence variants. 
- [SeqRepo](https://github.com/biocommons/biocommons.seqrepo) stores biological sequences in a
  non-redundant, compressed, journalled, file-based storage
- [seqreo-rest-service](https://github.com/biocommons/seqrepo-rest-service) provies a REST
  interface to biological sequences and sequence metadata
- [UTA](https://github.com/biocommons/uta) (Universal Transcript Archive) is a comprehensive archive
  of genome-transcript alignments; multiple transcript sources and versions, multiple genomic
  references, and multiple alignment methods, particularly splign (NCBI) and (blat) (UCSC)

### Incubating

- [anyvar](https://github.com/biocommons/anyvar) is a proof-of-concept variation translation, validation,
  and registration service
