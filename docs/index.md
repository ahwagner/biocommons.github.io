!!! info "Join Us!"

    The biocommons project began as an umbrella project for open source software that was released by
    [Invitae](https://invitae.com/). Biocommons software was subsequently used by groups at
    [ClinGen](https://clinicalgenome.org/), [Color](https://color.com/), [GA4GH](https://ga4gh.org/),
    [GenomOncology](https://genomoncology.com/), and many other institutions.

    **In order to ensure that existing projects continue to meet the needs of the community, and to
    provide a forum for related new software, the biocommons project is being restructured (December
    2022) in order to clarify governance, code of conduct, contribution policies, and coding
    guidelines.**

## Projects

### Released

- [bioutils](https://github.com/biocommons/bioutils) provides common tools and lookup tables used
  primarily by the hgvs and uta packages
- [eutils](https://github.com/biocommons/eutils) simplifies searching, fetching, and parsing records
  from NCBI using their E-utilities interface
- [hgvs](https://github.com/biocommons/hgvs) parses, formats, validates, normalizes,
  and transforms sequence variants.
- [SeqRepo](https://github.com/biocommons/biocommons.seqrepo) stores biological sequences in a
  non-redundant, compressed, journalled, file-based storage
- [seqreo-rest-service](https://github.com/biocommons/seqrepo-rest-service) provies a REST
  interface to biological sequences and sequence metadata
- [UTA](https://github.com/biocommons/uta) (Universal Transcript Archive) is a comprehensive archive
  of genome-transcript alignments; multiple transcript sources and versions, multiple genomic
  references, and multiple alignment methods, particularly splign (NCBI) and (blat) (UCSC)

### Incubating

- [anyvar](https://github.com/biocommons/anyvar) is a proof-of-concept variation translation, validation,
  and registration service
