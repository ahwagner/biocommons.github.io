## Projects

### Released

- [bioutils](https://github.com/biocommons/bioutils) provides common tools and lookup tables used
  primarily by the hgvs and uta packages
- [eutils](https://github.com/biocommons/eutils) simplified searching, fetching, and parsing records
  from NCBI using their E-utilities interface
- [hgvs](https://github.com/biocommons/hgvs) Python library to parse, format, validate, normalize,
  and map sequence variants.
- [SeqRepo](https://github.com/biocommons/biocommons.seqrepo) non-redundant, compressed, journalled,
  file-based storage for biological sequences
- [seqreo-rest-service](https://github.com/biocommons/seqrepo-rest-service) OpenAPI-based REST
  interface to biological sequences and sequence metadata
- [UTA](https://github.com/biocommons/uta) Universal Transcript Archive: comprehensive
  genome-transcript alignments; multiple transcript sources and versions, multiple genomic
  references, and multiple alignment methods, particularly splign (NCBI) and (blat) (UCSC)

### Incubating

- [anyvar](https://github.com/biocommons/anyvar) Proof-of-Concept variation translation, validation,
  and registration service


## Governance

- [Mission](mission.md): Why we exist (or longer executive summary?)
- [Culture](culture.md): How we treat each other respectfully
- [Governance](governance.md): How we organize to promote effective collaboration
- [Practices](practices.md) and [Tools](tools.md): How we get stuff done coherently
- [Architecture](architecture.md) and [Coding Guidelines](coding-guidelines.md): How we build interoperable tools with consistent behavior
- [Community](community.md): How you can get involved, learn, use, and contribute joyfully

## You're Invited!

The biocommons project began as an umbrella project for open source software that was released by
[Invitae](https://invitae.com/). Biocommons software was subsequently used by groups at
[ClinGen](https://clinicalgenome.org/), [Color](https://color.com/), [GA4GH](https://ga4gh.org/),
[GenomOncology](https://genomoncology.com/), and many other institutions.

**In order to ensure that existing projects continue to meet the needs of the community, and to
provide a forum for related new software, the biocommons project is being restructured (November
2022) in order to clarify governance, code of conduct, contribution policies, and coding
guidelines.**
