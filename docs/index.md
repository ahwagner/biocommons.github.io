# Welcome to the biocommons!

<img width="10%" src="images/logo.svg" style="float: left; margin: 0 25px 0 25px;">

<b>The biocommons project is a community of diagnostic testing labs and academic
groups that fosters pre-competitive collaboration on interoperable and
high-quality bioinformatics software and data, primarily  for sequence variant
interpretation.</b>

## Projects

### Production

- [bioutils](https://github.com/biocommons/bioutils) provides common tools and lookup tables used
  primarily by the hgvs and uta packages
- [eutils](https://github.com/biocommons/eutils) simplified searching, fetching, and parsing records
  from NCBI using their E-utilities interface- [hgvs](https://github.com/biocommons/hgvs) Python
  library to parse, format, validate, normalize, and map sequence variants.
- [SeqRepo](https://github.com/biocommons/biocommons.seqrepo) non-redundant, compressed, journalled,
  file-based storage for biological sequences
- [seqreo-rest-service](https://github.com/biocommons/seqrepo-rest-service) OpenAPI-based REST
  interface to biological sequences and sequence metadata
- [UTA](https://github.com/biocommons/uta) Universal Transcript Archive: comprehensive
  genome-transcript alignments; multiple transcript sources and versions, multiple genomic
  references, and multiple alignment methods, particularly splign (NCBI) and (blat) (UCSC)

### Incubating

- [anyvar](https://github.com/biocommons/anyvar) Proof-of-Concept variation translation, validation,
  and registration service

## You're Invited!

The biocommons project began as an umbrella project for open source software that was released by
[Invitae](https://invitae.com/). Biocommons software was subsequently used by groups at
[ClinGen](https://clinicalgenome.org/), [Color](https://color.com/), [GA4GH](https://ga4gh.org/),
[GenomOncology](https://genomoncology.com/), and many other institutions.  In order to ensure that
existing projects continue to meet the needs of the community, and to provide a forum for related
new software, the biocommons project will be rebooted in order to clarify governance, code of
conduct, contribution policies, and coding guidelines. See the [reboot preview pages](reboot/) for
more information.
