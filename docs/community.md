## Slack

  This is the best way to get fast answers.

## Groups

!!! note "Groups aren't just for email anymore!"
    Google groups are used to grant access to files, invite people to meetings, and, of
    course, for email distribution.  If you can't access files or aren't getting calendar
    invitations, you may need to check your group membership.

    Announcement lists: Announcements only; no posting.
    Discussion lists: Anyone may join. First posts are moderated.

* [biocommons-announce](https://groups.google.com/g/biocommons-announce)
  Announcement list. Low-volume, read-only list primarily for announcements of new releases, meetings, and similar
  information.

* [biocommons-devs](https://groups.google.com/g/biocommons-devs)
  Discussion list for developers of biocommons tools.

* [biocommons-hacakathons](https://groups.google.com/g/biocommons-hackathons)
  Discussion list for biocommons hackathons.

* [biocommons-users](https://groups.google.com/g/biocommons-users)
  Discussion list for users to ask (and answer!) questions about tools.

* [biocommons-devops](https://groups.google.com/g/biocommons-devops)
  Announcement list with automated messages from ci/cd bots, potentially high-volume chatter.

  Discussion list to discuss hgvs (the package) and HGVS (the recommendations). Deprecated; use
  biocommons-users instead.
